# Data Analysis with Power BI

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis using Power BI.
I've sourced data from multiple databases to answer key business questions.
The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and I have created several measures, 
columns, and tables using DAX. 

My Power BI report presents the data through interactive visualizations, 
providing insights into the trends and patterns in the data.
